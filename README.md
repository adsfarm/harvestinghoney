# HARVESTING HONEY

### Equipment:
- Bee suit
- Gloves
- Gumboots
- Smoker
- Bee brush
- Hive tool
- Bucket with lid
- Spot light
- Knife
- Twigs

#### When should harvesting be done?
- First harvest should be done about six months after colonization of the hive
- Harvesting should be done three times in a year (intervals of about four months)
- Should be done when the honeycombs are about 80% to 90% capped
- Should be done late in the afternoon/at dust to avoid the bees going wild and attacking people and animals in the surrounding

#### Process
NB: The process outlined below targets the small scale beekeeper who relies on domestic straining to process the harvested honey

- Put on the protective bee suit
- Put the dry twigs into the smoker and light
- Carry the harvesting equipment to the apiary. Puff smoke from the smoker as you approach the apiary.
- Approach the apiary from the back of the hives.
- Puff smoke around the apiary a few times before entering the apiaryâ€™
- Inside the apiary;
- Visit each hive , 
- Puff some smoke around the hive and into the hive
- Remove the cover
- Using the hive tool remove the frames one by one .
- Using the bee brush remove the bees from each frame before cutting off the combs
- Using a knife cut off the comb from the frame and put it into the bucket. Cover the bucket with the lid
- Do this with frames which have 80% of their combs capped and above
- After cutting off the combs replace all the frames in their right position in the hive .
- Cover the hive with its cover 
- Place the hive back to its position
